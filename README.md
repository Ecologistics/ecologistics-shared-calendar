## Overview

### Purpose

The environmental community in San Luis Obispo has repeatedly had scheduling conflicts between different organizations that split the possible attendees, and confuse volunteers. We aim to create a centralized place for different charitable groups to post events on a calendar, to create better communication for volunteer-to-organization, and organization-to-organization.

### Team

The Ecologistics Calendar team consists of 15 Cal Poly students. Over the course of about 9 months, we worked as a team to deploy this web application. The team members are listed below:
